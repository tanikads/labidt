10.1007/s11116-019-10019-5,,,"To compete or not compete: exploring the relationships between motorcycle-based ride-sourcing, motorcycle taxis, and public transport in the Jakarta metropolitan area","In the last decade, the emergence of ride-sourcing services has transformed personal trip behavior. In the context of Indonesia, ride-sourcing services have evolved into two modes of transport: motorcycle-based and car-based. The presence of such services has strongly impacted consumers’ choices of travel mode. However, the main question is whether the ride-sourcing service is a complement or a substitute for the existing public transport and conventional taxis. Using 438 motorcycle-based, ride-sourcing consumers, we applied a structural equation model to investigate the relationships between motorcycle-based ride-sourcing, motorcycle taxis, and public transport in the Jakarta Metropolitan Area. The result shows that motorcycle-based ride-sourcing works as a complementary mode for the TransJakarta bus and Jakarta commuter train, but as a competitor with the motorcycle taxis. Contrarily, motorcycle taxis supported the existence of motorcycle-based ride-sourcing. The study also found that individuals use motorcycle taxis as feeders to transit stops. Individuals commonly use motorcycle taxis and motorcycle-based ride-sourcing for short travel distances. The demographic features and technology use experience also drive individuals’ choice of the three transportation modes. Integrating public transport with motorcycle-based ride-source services, and legalizing motorcycle taxis and motorcycle-based ride sourcing as forms of public transport are two main proposed policies that seek to increase public transport demand, ensure service quality, safety, and fares, and reduce the potential conflict between all three.","Muhammad Zudhy Irawan,Prawira F.

10.1108/meq-10-2021-0236,,,Climate change and pro-environmental behaviours: the significant environmental challenges of livelihoods,"Purpose The study investigates the intention to adopt climate change and the pro-environmental behaviours among the residents of a developing country (Pakistan) through the theory of planned behaviour (TPB). Design/methodology/approach This is a quantitative designed study and uses a questionnaire to collect cross-sectional data. The authors distributed about 1,600 questionnaires, of which 980 were returned; this represented a 61% response rate. Findings From applying the PLS-SEM 3.0 technique, the findings highlight the positive and significant impact of attitudes towards climate change (ATCC) and subjective norms (SN) on the intention to adopt climate change (ITCC). On the other hand, perceived behavioural control (PBC) has an insignificant effect on ITCC. Moreover, the ITCC is a significant predictor of pro-environmental behaviour (PEB). Finally, ITCC has a positive effect in mediating the relationship between TPB constructs (ATCC, SN and PBC) and PEB. Practical implications This study's findings assist policymakers in designing policies and better plans to enrich the individuals' vision and attitudes towards creating a conducive and healthy environment. Further, this study's findings encourage the promotion of widespread intentions to overcome the environmental challenges of climate change. Originality/value In the context of Pakistan, this study's findings offer empirical confirmation of TPB, climate change and PEB.","Nadia A.

In this study, based on the traffic conditions of 2013 in Dublin, Ireland, the impact of a change in transport infrastructure, a traffic regulation change, speed limit changes and fleet composition changes on air quality and air pollution related public health were assessed. Two pollutants are considered in this study: NO2 and PM2.5. A traffic model, emissions model, dispersion model and a health impact model were adopted. The construction of new infrastructure and changes in traffic management were predicted to have contrasting effects on different parts of the city, bringing little benefit to the city as a whole. The mortality incidence change brought about by changes in NO2 concentration due to reductions in speed limits were predicted to be an increase of 22.4 deaths in 2013. A fleet composition change from diesel to petrol vehicles was predicted to reduce the PM2.5 and NO2 concentration and relevant mortality incidence for the whole city. The study highlighted the importance of the consideration of all possible affected areas within a city. It also highlighted the balance of the safety issues and the environmental health impact, when assessing the impact of traffic management strategies.","Jiayi Tang,Aonghus McNabola,Bruce Misstear",Sustainable Cities and Society,2020
10.1016/j.trd.2020.102242,,,From willingness to action: Do push-pull-mooring factors matter for shifting to green transportation?,"Abstract   Motivating individuals to choose green transportation is becoming increasingly important. Based on push-pull-mooring framework, this study aims to explore how push, pull and mooring factors foster individual’s willingness to shift to green transportation. This study also analyzes the role of information provision in narrowing the gap between shifting willingness and behavior. The findings revealed that push factors, including perceived environmental threats and perceived inconvenience, drive individual’s mode-shift away from private cars, whereas the pull factors, including green transport policies and campaigns, and green transport system attract individual’s mode-shift to green transportation. Moreover, the mooring factor, namely inertia, not only negatively affects individual’s shifting willingness but also negatively moderates the effects of push and pull factors on individual’s shifting willingness. In addition, shifting willingness positively affects the shifting behavior and the information provision positively moderates the relationship among them. Such findings are vital to achieve the realization of China’s low-carbon goals.","Shanyong Wang,Jing Wang,Feng Yang",Transportation Research Part D-transport and Environment,2020

In this study we report on an experiment designed to compare atmospheric contaminants inhaled during bus, subway train, tram and walking journeys through the city of Barcelona. Average number concentrations of particles 10-300 nm in size,  N , are lowest in the commute using subway trains ( N  4 part.cm −3 ), higher during tram travel and suburban walking (2.5×10 4 cm −3  N  4 cm −3 ), and highest in diesel bus or walking in the city centre ( N >5.0×10 4 cm −3 ), with extreme transient peaks at busy traffic crossings commonly exceeding 1.0×10 5 cm −3  and accompanied by peaks in Black Carbon and CO. Subway particles are coarser (mode 90nm) than in buses, trams or outdoors ( 2.5 ) and Black Carbon are lower in the tram when compared to both bus and subway. CO 2  levels in public transport reflect passenger numbers, more than tripling from outdoor levels to >1200ppm in crowded buses and trains. There are also striking differences in inhalable particle chemistry depending on the route chosen, ranging from aluminosiliceous at roadsides and near pavement works, ferruginous with enhanced Mn, Co, Zn, Sr and Ba in the subway environment, and higher levels of Sb and Cu inside the bus. We graphically display such chemical variations using a ternary diagram to emphasise how “air quality” in the city involves a consideration of both physical and chemical parameters, and is not simply a question of measuring particle number or mass.","Teresa Moreno,Cristina Reche,Ioar Rivas,María Cruz Minguillón,Vânia Martins,Concepción Vargas,Giorgio Buonanno,Jesus Parga,Marco Pandolfi,M.

10.1371/journal.pone.0201138,30067806,,Optimal public-transport operational strategies to reduce cost and vehicle's emission.,"Public transport passenger demand is inevitably made non-uniform because of spatial and temporal land use planning. This non-uniformity warrants the use of public transport operational strategies to attain operating efficiency. The optimization of these strategies is commonly being done from the operator perspective, and indirectly from the user perspective. However, the environmental perspective of these strategies, in terms of vehicle’s emission, has not been investigated. This study proposed a methodology to analyze the benefits of using transit operational strategies to reduce operating cost and eventually also to reduce undesirable emissions. First, a strategy-based optimization model is established to minimize the number of transit vehicles required. Four candidate operational strategies are considered in this model, including full route operation (FRO), short turn, limited stop, and a combination of limited stop and short turn. Second, the pollutant emissions of transit vehicles are estimated by the MOVES emission model. The developed methodology is applied to a real life case study in Dalian, China. Results show that the use of operational strategies can not only significantly save the number of vehicles by 12.5%, but also reduce emissions of pollutants (i.e., CO2, HC, CO, NOx, PM2.5) by approximately 13%, compared with applying FRO strategy exclusively. In addition, both benefits can be further enhanced through the use of an efficient payment mode (e.g., off-board or contactless card) or improving bus performance in deceleration/acceleration as well as doors opening and closing at a stop.","Chunyan Tang,Avishai Ceder,Ying-En Ge",PLOS ONE,2018
10.24112/jaes.020103,,,What Influences the Choice Between Private Car and Public Transport for Shopping Trips? Impact of Socio-economic and Built Environment Factors,"Shifting toward sustainable daily travel will play a significant role in the future of sustainable development and the lowering of carbon emissions. This study provides an in-depth comparison of transport mode choice and corresponding CO2emissions between private cars and public transport used for shopping trips based on individual data from a travel survey conducted in Shenyang, China. The analysis found that bus travel accounted for the majority of motorized transportation. Public transport users were closely distributed along the bus or metro lines, and aggregated private car users were mainly clustered within the second circumferential road. Furthermore, average per trip emissions for private car travel were 8-fold that of public transport. Binary logistic regression modeling was employed to examine factors that were related to the choice between private car and public transport, and the results indicated that car ownership and gender were the most important factors in explaining the preference of car driving. Age and per capita monthly income were negatively correlated with car driving. In addition, there were also negative impacts associated to the built environment factors of access to the closest metro stations and the number of bus stops near the residence on car driving. This study is vital to formulate more effective transportation policy measures in the future development for a sustainable low-carbon city.

10.1016/j.tranpol.2007.04.009,,,Understanding attitudes towards public transport and private car: A qualitative study,"This paper presents the results of a qualitative study of public transport users and car users in order to obtain a deeper understanding of travellers' attitudes towards transport and to explore perceptions of public transport service quality. The key findings indicate that in order to increase public transport usage, the service should be designed in a way that accommodates the levels of service required by customers and by doing so, attract potential users. Furthermore, the choice of transport is influenced by several factors, such as individual characteristics and lifestyle, the type of journey, the perceived service performance of each transport mode and situational variables. This suggests the need for segmentation taking into account travel attitudes and behaviours. Policies which aim to influence car usage should be targeted at the market segments that are most motivated to change and willing to reduce frequency of car use.","Gabriela Beirão,J.

10.3390/su14106248,,,The Impact of Public Transportation on Carbon Emissions—From the Perspective of Energy Consumption,"Background: Transportation has become the second-largest source of global carbon emissions. Promoting low-carbon development by means of public transport and green travel and analyzing the mechanism and path of the carbon emissions reduction effect of public transport have become key to reducing carbon emissions in the transportation field and achieving “carbon peak and carbon neutrality”. Methods: The data from 30 provinces (2010–2019) were extracted from China Emission Accounts and Datasets (CEADs), China Energy Statistical Yearbook, China Statistical Yearbook, and China Automobile Statistical Yearbook. The two-way fixed-effect model was used to explore the carbon emissions reduction effect of public transport development level. The mediating-effect model was used to verify the transmission role of energy consumption in the carbon emissions reduction effect of public transport development level. Results: The study suggests that the public transport development level and CO2 emissions are negatively correlated, showing an “Inverted U-shaped” curve relationship. Energy consumption is the transmission path of the carbon emissions reduction effect of public transport development level. The public transport development level adjusts the energy consumption structure through the traffic substitution effect, energy input optimization effect, and industrial structure optimization effect and then acts on carbon emissions. Moreover, the contribution rate of energy consumption is about 4.22%. In addition, regional heterogeneity is present in the transmission path of the carbon emissions reduction effect of public transport development level based on energy consumption. The carbon emissions reduction effect of public transport development level is more significant in the central and western regions than the eastern and northeast regions of China. Conclusion: The transmission mechanism of energy consumption in the carbon emissions reduction effect of public transport is worthy of attention. To promote low-carbon and circular development in the transportation sector, it is urgent to accelerate the green upgrading of transportation infrastructure, promote the low-carbon transformation of energy production and consumption, promote carbon emissions reduction in public transport, and strengthen the linkage regulation between effective government and an effective market.","Qin-Lei Jing,Han-Zhen Liu,Wei-Qing Yu,Xu He",Sustainability,2022
10.1016/j.tranpol.2004.11.004,,,'Complacent Car Addicts' or 'Aspiring Environmentalists'? Identifying travel behaviour segments using attitude theory,"Using an expanded version of a psychological theory of attitude-behaviour relations, namely the theory of planned behaviour (TPB), scores on factor analysed multi-dimensional attitude statements were used to segment a population of day trip travellers into potential 'mode switchers' using cluster analysis. Six distinct psychographic groups were extracted, each with varying degrees of mode switching potential. Each group represents a unique combination of preferences, worldviews and attitudes, indicating that different groups need to be serviced in different ways to optimise the chance of influencing mode choice behaviour. Socio-demographic factors had little bearing on the travel profiles of the segments, suggesting that attitudes largely cut across personal characteristics. The evidence clearly shows that the same behaviour can take place for different reasons and that the same attitudes can lead to different behaviours. The paper asserts that commonly used a priori classifications used to segment populations based on demographic variables or simple behavioural measures may oversimplify the structure of the market. Cluster analysis is rarely used in studies of travel behaviour but this study demonstrates its utility in providing a way of extracting naturally occurring, relatively homogenous and meaningful groups to be used in designing targeted hard and 'soft' transport policies.",Jillian Anable,Transport Policy,2005
10.1016/j.tranpol.2012.11.005,,,Quality attributes of public transport that attract car users : A research review,"The transport sector presents contentious issues with respect to sustainable development, particularly regarding the use of private motorised vehicles in urban areas. Public transport (PT) together with cycling and walking are generally agreed to be sustainable alternatives to private car use. This paper aims to contribute to a better understanding of those aspects of PT quality most likely to attract car users. Toward achieving this aim, relevant research was sought to answer the following two questions: What quality attributes of PT services are attractive to users? And what changes in quality attributes of PT services would encourage modal shift from private motor vehicles to PT? Using a qualitative systematic review, it is concluded that while service reliability and frequency are important PT attributes in general, those attributes most effective in attracting car users are largely affective and connected to individual perceptions, motivations and contexts. Reduced fare promotions and other habit-interrupting transport policy measures can succeed in encouraging car users to try PT services initially. Attributes over and above basic accessibility, reliability and mobility provision, perceived by the target market as important service attributes, must then be provided in sustaining the switch from car use after promotional tactics have expired.","Lauren Redman,Margareta Friman,Tommy Gärling,Terry Hartig",Transport Policy,2013

The use of private cars is still increasing and has become an integrated part of both modern society and of the life of individuals and families. It has a role to play not only as a means of transport but also in cultural and social life. One has to know and understand this whole picture if the intention is to change the pattern of transport in order to solve the environmental problems within and from the transport sector. This article is presenting the results from a research project1 that was dealing with these issues. The research project consists of two parts -- a qualitative as well as a quantitative study. The qualitative study is based on 20 in-depth interviews with 30 persons in all. Among other things the interviews were used to develop types of travellers. This has created six mobility types: The passionate car drivers, the daily life car drivers, the leisure time car drivers, the cyclists/public transport users of heart, the cyclists/public transport users of convenience and the cyclists/public transport users of necessity. The quantitative study is consisting of a survey among 1000 persons based on the qualitative interviews, and is inter alia quantifying the six mobility types. The six types will be described and analysed below. The objective of the research project was on how transport (i.e. the car) has become part of everyday life, on transport behaviour, on attitudes towards transport, on environmental consciousness and -- as an important point -- on transport as integrated in modern culture. Contradictions between motoring and environment are analysed, and some possibilities of changes in transport behaviour are discussed.",Mette Jensen,Transport Policy,1999

This study explores the modal shift potential of this measure for commuters by means of a large-scale survey. The results indicate that there is still a margin for a further modal shift, but in order to make public transport more attractive to car users, the price paid by the commuter should be lowered, the quality and capacity of the public services should be improved and the mobility policy of the companies should be adjusted in favour of public transport.","Astrid De Witte,Cathy Macharis,Olivier Mairesse",Transport Policy,2008
10.1016/s1369-8478(03)00027-5,,,In the driving seat: psychosocial benefits from private motor vehicle transport compared to public transport,"The aim of current transport policy in the UK and many other developed countries is to reduce reliance on private motor vehicle transport in order to promote public health and reduce environmental degradation. Despite the emphasis in these policies on the unhealthiness of private motor car use, epidemiological studies have consistently shown that car access is associated with longevity and better health. We examine this paradox using a postal survey of adults in the West of Scotland (n=2043, m=896, f=1147) to investigate the psychosocial benefits associated with private and public motor vehicle transport. Those with access to a car appear to gain more psychosocial benefits (mastery, self esteem, and feelings of autonomy, protection, and prestige) than public transport users from their habitual mode of transport. Being a car driver conferred more benefits than being a passenger, except for self esteem which was only associated with driving among men. Self-esteem was also associated with type of car among men but not women. This study suggests that if people are to be encouraged to reduce private motor vehicle use, policies need to take into account some of the psychosocial benefits people might derive from such use.","Anne Ellaway,Sally Macintyre,Rosemary Hiscock,Ade Kearns",Transportation Research Part F-traffic Psychology and Behaviour,2003

10.1016/j.tra.2004.07.001,,,"Car use: lust and must. Instrumental, symbolic and affective motives for car use","This paper reports results of two questionnaire studies aimed at examining various motives for car use. In the first study, a random selection of 185 respondents who possess a driving licence were interviewed. Respondents were recruited from the cities of Groningen and Rotterdam, The Netherlands. The sample of the second study comprised a random selection of 113 commuters who regularly travelled during rush hours in and around Rotterdam, a region in the west of the Netherlands. First, it was examined which categories of car use motives may be distinguished. As proposed by Dittmar's (1992) [The social psychology of material possessions: to have is to be. Havester Wheatsheaf, Hemel Hempstead, UK; St. Martin's Press, New York] model on the meaning of material possessions, results from both studies revealed that car use not only fulfils instrumental functions, but also important symbolic and affective functions. Second, it was studied to what extent these different motives are related to the level of car use. From the results of study 2, it appeared that commuter car use was most strongly related to symbolic and affective motives, and not to instrumental motives. Third, individual differences in the relative importance of the three categories of motives were investigated. In both studies, most group differences were found in the evaluation of the symbolic and affective motives (and not the instrumental ones). Especially frequent drivers, respondents with a positive car attitude, male and younger respondents valued these non-instrumental motives for car use. These results suggest that policy makers should not exclusively focus on instrumental motives for car use, but they should consider the many social and affective motives as well.",Linda Steg,Transportation Research Part A-policy and Practice,2005
10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-t,,,The theory of planned behavior,"Research dealing with various aspects of* the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1985, 1987) is reviewed, and some unresolved issues are discussed. In broad terms, the theory is found to be well supported by empirical evidence. Intentions to perform behaviors of different kinds can be predicted with high accuracy from attitudes toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control; and these intentions, together with perceptions of behavioral control, account for considerable variance in actual behavior. Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are shown to be related to appropriate sets of salient behavioral, normative, and control beliefs about the behavior, but the exact nature of these relations is still uncertain. Expectancy— value formulations are found to be only partly successful in dealing with these relations. Optimal rescaling of expectancy and value measures is offered as a means of dealing with measurement limitations. Finally, inclusion of past behavior in the prediction equation is shown to provide a means of testing the theory*s sufficiency, another issue that remains unresolved. The limited available evidence concerning this question shows that the theory is predicting behavior quite well in comparison to the ceiling imposed by behavioral reliability. © 1991 Academic Press.

However, worldwide massive car use causes serious environmental problems. Although breakthroughs in clean automobile technology may be under way, reducing car use seems necessary in order to achieve a sustainable transportation system. Several travel demand management (TDM) measures have therefore been proposed and some have been implemented with this aim. The article reviews research addressing the question of how effective, acceptable to the public, and politically feasible such measures are. The conclusion is that noncoercive TDM measures alone are unlikely to be effective in reducing car use. Therefore, coercive TDM measures such as increasing cost for or prohibiting car use may be necessary but are difficult to implement because of public opposition and political infeasibility. If combined with noncoercive TDM measures providing attractive travel alternatives and communicating the benefits of car-use reduction to the public, coercive TDM measures are likely to become more effective, acceptable, and politically feasible.","Tommy Gärling,Geertje Schuitema",Journal of Social Issues,2007

This paper hypothesizes that if a temporary change in public transportation service level induces lasting psychological changes, travel mode choice also may permanently change. An experiment targeting 43 drivers was conducted, in which a one-month free bus ticket was given to 23 drivers in an experimental group but not to 20 drivers in a control group. Attitudes towards, habits of and frequency of using automobiles and buses were measured immediately before, immediately after and one month after the one-month long intervention. Results showed that attitudes toward bus were more positive, frequency of bus use increased, and the habit of automobile use decreased from before the intervention, even one month after the intervention period. Furthermore, the increase in habitual bus use had the largest effect on the increase in the frequency of bus use. The results indicate a temporary structural change does seem to have the potential to change habit, attitude and travel mode choice, making it an effective candidate as a travel demand management tool.","Satoshi Fujii,Ryuichi Kitamura",,2003

The aim of this review is to fill this gap by elaborating a common modal choice definition and by providing a comprehensive review on the concept of modal choice through linking it to Kaufmann’s motility concept. By doing so, this review will not only contribute to an improved knowledge on different modal choice determinants and their interdependencies, but can also assist to the understanding and modeling of modal choice decisions. The review can therefore help increasing the effectiveness of policy measures taken by environmental, urban and transport policy makers.","Astrid De Witte,Joachim Hollevoet,Frédéric Dobruszkes,Michel Hubert,Cathy Macharis,Cathy Macharis",Transportation Research Part A-policy and Practice,2013
10.1111/j.1559-1816.2002.tb02068.x,,,Extending the theory of planned behavior: Predicting the use of public transportation,"An expanded version of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) was used to predict and explain public transportation use. A pre-post design was used to examine changes in university students’ bus ridership after the implementation of a universal bus pass (U-pass) program. Bus ridership significantly increased after the U-pass was implemented, and associated changes in attitudes and beliefs about transportation modes were found. In both phases, students’ public transportation use was well predicted by the original TPB. However, 2 additional constructs—a descriptive norm, and the interaction between intention and perceived behavioral control—significantly improved prediction in both phases of the study. These constructs might be useful additions to the original TPB, at least in this behavioral domain.","Yuko Heath,Robert Gifford",Journal of Applied Social Psychology,2002

The second aim was to determine the value placed on the comfort and reliability of public transport services. An online survey of workers who commute daily into Dublin was conducted, which collected data on the respondents' typical commute, commute-related stress, and socioeconomic background. Commute satisfaction levels among public transport users were found to decrease for those who travel on crowded or unreliable services and those who have long wait-times. Stated preference scenarios relating to crowding and reliability were analyzed using a multinomial logit model. The model showed that utility derived increases as crowding decreases and as reliability increases.","Mairead Cantwell,Brian Caulfield,Margaret O'Mahony",The Journal of Public Transportation,2009

We propose a conceptual framework which links the two and examine a selection of indicators which might be used in assessing the outcomes of policies designed to use increased mobility to reduce exclusion. An illustrative example of the use of London Transport's CAPITAL model is demonstrated to assess access to regeneration sites. We conclude that increasing access to activities and services requires combating individuals' constraints at either end of their journey in addition to transport system improvements.,"Andrew Church,Martin Frost,K Sullivan",Transport Policy,2000
10.1016/s0965-8564(02)00075-7,,,Service quality––developing a service quality index in the provision of commercial bus contracts,"The measurement of service quality continues to be a challenging research theme and one of great practical importance to service providers and regulatory agencies. The key challenges begin with the identification of the set of potentially important dimensions of service quality perceived by passengers, current and potential. We then have to establish a way of measuring each attribute and identifying their relative importance in the overall calculation of satisfaction associated with existing service levels. Once a set of relevant attributes has been identified, this information can be integrated into programs such as monitoring and benchmarking, and even in contract specification. This paper, building on earlier research by the authors, investigates ways of quantifying service quality and comparing the levels within and between bus operators. The importance of establishing suitable market segments and the need to scale the service quality index for each operator to make meaningful comparisons is highlighted.","David A. Hensher,Peter R.

This dissatisfaction measure is plotted against importance to provide a graphic representation of which aspects of service are in most urgent need of improvement. Examples are given from three recent studies conducted by the authors, showing how the technique may be used in the transport domain to compare different aspects of a particular service (e.g., user satisfaction with bus interchange), to compare across modes (e.g., user satisfaction with trips to a leisure location by car and bus), or to compare within a mode across population sub-groups (e.g., younger and older able-bodied pedestrians’ satisfaction with a walking environment).","Stephen G.

10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.09.729,,,Structural Equation Modelling for Analysing Passengers’ Perceptions about Railway Services,"In this work a tool for analysing passengers’ perceptions in terms of satisfaction with transit services is proposed. Specifically, a structural equation model is formulated to explore the impact of the relationship between global customer satisfaction and service quality attributes, such as safety, cleanliness, main and additional services, information, and personnel. We analyse the services offered by rail operators in the Northern Italy; specifically, 32 regional lines and 9 suburban lines connecting different towns of the hinterland of the city of Milan, and 2 express lines connecting Milan with the Malpensa airport are analysed. To calibrate the model, data collected in a survey addressed to a sample of more than 16,000 passengers are used. The survey was conducted in June 2011. The proposed model can be useful both to transport agencies and planners to analyze the correlation between service quality attributes and identify the most convenient attributes for improving the supplied service. The main findings are that service characteristics like punctuality, regularity and frequency of runs, and cleanliness have the highest positive effect on service quality. While also comfort and information have a notable positive effect, personnel and safety have a not very considerable effect.","Laura Eboli,Gabriella Mazzulla",Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences,2012

The aim is to explore user perceptions of privately owned paratransit service operations, regarding quality of service, frequency of negative experience, and loyalty. The paper examines the condition of paratransit from the user’s point of view to balance the judgment from other stakeholders. Findings from path analysis reveal the key determinants that influence overall satisfaction. Moreover, path analysis supports the hypothesis that this mode will still be relevant in the future, as there is a community base that uses this mode faithfully. Binomial regression analysis explores the characteristics of this loyal user group. It can be concluded that the existence of paratransit in the future is still acceptable in developing countries such as Indonesia.","Tri Basuki Joewono,Hisashi Kubota",The Journal of Public Transportation,2007
10.1348/000712605x61723,16613647,,The role of affect in UK commuters' travel mode choices: An interpretative phenomenological analysis,"Previous research has suggested that the choice between public transport and private car use is not solely based on utility considerations, such as time and cost. However, affective considerations tend not to be targeted in policy interventions to reduce car use. This may be due, in part, to a lack of clarity about which affective responses to car use are important and how they may affect willingness to switch to public transport. This study sought to clarify the role of affective responses in transport mode choice. An interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) of car users' accounts was conducted to (i) explore affect associated with decisions to drive or use public transport to get to work; and (ii) describe the role of affect on such transport decisions, and its relationship to utility considerations. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 car users employed at a medium-sized UK university. Four affect themes were identified: These were journey-based affect (JBA), personal space, autonomy and identity. Typical 'utility' factors such as time, cost and reliability had important affective effects, and these were considered alongside utility components (e.g. getting to work on time). However, these effects were not always additive, and the role of affect depended on participants' own assessment of their circumstances. Implications for interventions are discussed.","Eleanor Mann,Charles Abraham",British Journal of Psychology,2006

To this end, a two-dimensional IPA grid displayed the results of the evaluation about importance and performance of each relevant attribute. This paper shows that ordinal preferences are better than metric measures of the importance dimension and proposes a formula to transform the ordinal measure into a new metric scale adapted to the IPA grid. This formula makes allowances for the total number of features considered, the number of rankings, and the reported orders of preference.","Javier Abalo,Jesús A.

This impact has also increasingly challenged the future existence of such road-based urban public transport as paratransit due to its characteristics and problems, especially in developing countries. Since creating satisfied users can help retain paratransit’s existence, this research aims to explore user satisfaction with paratransit service in order to anticipate future implications for its competition with motorization in Bandung, Indonesia. It establishes important factors and attributes to explain user perceptions and priorities regarding the service. Its hypotheses explain how users measure paratransit’s quality of service, inferring that they are likely to continue to use it. Even though users are dissatisfied with several aspects of paratransit, and the impact of competition has been strong, loyal users can still be found. By considering the findings, existing problems of inappropriate-quality service can be addressed to satisfy users’ expectations. The study also suggests some anticipation of winning the competition with motorization.","Tri Basuki Joewono,Hisashi Kubota",Transportation,2007

(2) What effect do quality improvements have on passengers perceived frequency of negative critical incidents? A representative sample of persons aged 16-75 years old in the thirteen regions in Sweden conducting quality improvements in public transport were used. Data were collected before it started and also after the improvements had been completed (n=2797). The pre-and post samples consisted of independent groups of respondents. The response rate was 54%. The main conclusion of the study is that the satisfaction people experience when using public transport services is influenced by quality improvements only to a limited extent. Furthermore, the effect was directionally opposite in that the respondents reported less satisfaction and higher frequencies of negative critical incidents after the quality improvements had been implemented",Margareta Friman,The Journal of Public Transportation,2004

Governments enact various policies to encourage car drivers to change their behaviour, but often find that the full impact is not reached. We propose that car drivers have constraints influencing their mode choice for the morning peak period trip (e.g. needing to transport children, needing a car for work during the day). A stated preference experiment conducted in the three largest New Zealand urban areas not only quantifies the likely impact of a wide range of policy tools (both 'sticks' discouraging car use, and 'carrots' encouraging alternative modes) for each area, but also identifies many significant constraints.","Carolyn O'Fallon,C Sullivan,David A.

10.1016/j.tra.2008.08.002,,,Access to railway stations and its potential in increasing rail use,"The propensity to travel by rail, and not, for example by car, can be considered to be a factor of the rail service offered, the access to it and the characteristics of the population served. Efforts to increase rail use usually focus on the rail service itself while the accessibility of the rail network receives less attention. In this context, the paper has two broad aims. First, to evaluate how important the 'access-to-the-station' part of a rail journey is to passengers in their overall satisfaction with the rail journey and second, to investigate the balance between characteristics of the service, the access to it and the population served in determining rail use in different parts of the rail network. The analysis is carried out for the Netherlands. To achieve the first aim, we use the Dutch Railways customer satisfaction survey and apply principal component analysis and derived importance techniques to assess the relative importance of accessibility in determining the overall satisfaction with the rail journey. For the second aim, we use regression analysis to explain, at the Dutch postcode level, the propensity to use rail. We find that satisfaction with the level and quality of the access to the station is an important dimension of the rail journey which influences the overall satisfaction from that journey and that the quality and level of accessibility is an important element in explaining rail use. The conclusion reached is that in many parts of the rail network improving and expanding access services to the railway station can substitute for improving and expanding the services provided on the rail network and that it is probably more cost efficient when the aim is to increase rail use. These parts of the network are mainly in the periphery where the current level of rail service is relatively low.","Martijn Brons,Moshe Givoni,Piet Rietveld,Piet Rietveld",Transportation Research Part A-policy and Practice,2009

The methodology is based on the use of both passenger perceptions and transit agency performance measures involving the main aspects characterizing a transit service. The combination of these two types of service quality measurement fulfils the need to provide a reliable as possible measurement tool of the transit performance. Considering passenger perceptions is fundamental because the customer's point of view is very relevant for evaluating the performance of a transit service. At the same time, the use of a more objective measurement provided by the transit agency can be a useful solution for obtaining a more comprehensive service quality measurement. The proposed procedure is applied to a real case study of a suburban bus line; a series of subjective and objective indicators are calculated on the basis of users' perception about the service and measurements provided by the transit agency.","Laura Eboli,Gabriella Mazzulla",Transport Policy,2011

10.1016/j.tra.2007.06.006,,,Measuring the quality of service for passengers on the hellenic railways,"The objective of this paper is to present a framework developed for assisting railway operators into monitoring and controlling the quality of services provided to their passengers. This framework is based on the estimation of 22 indicators, grouped under six criteria, i.e. itinerary accuracy, system safety, cleanness, passenger comfort, servicing, and passenger information. The valuation of the indicators is achieved through the analysis of quantitative, as well as qualitative parameters obtained either from statistical sources maintained by the railway operator, or data gathered from a questionnaire survey addressed to passengers. A grading system has been defined for the appreciation of the indicators. Also, a multicriteria evaluation has been developed for the estimation of an overall performance index for the quality of services provided by the operator, during a given period of analysis, which enables the decision makers to compare amongst different time horizons, and pre-defined objectives for a desired performance for a target year. The framework has been implemented in the Hellenic Railways and has provided quality control indices for the individual indicators, as well as for the overall performance of the network. Itinerary accuracy and system safety have been attributed the highest grades, as compared to the rest of the criteria established by the framework, indicating a small increase as compared to those grades of the previous time horizon analyzed. The rest of the criteria, relying on qualitative indicators, were valuated with a moderate grade, similar to the one attributed during the last time horizon of the analysis, indicating that no improvement has been observed in the services related to those indicators. The service quality valuation based on the above framework constitutes a useful tool, for the support of the decision process for the improvement of the railway operator.",Eftihia Nathanail,Transportation Research Part A-policy and Practice,2008
,,,Fighting Traffic: The Dawn of the Motor Age in the American City,"Before the advent of the automobile, users of city streets were diverse and included children at play and pedestrians at large. By 1930, most streets were primarily a motor thoroughfares where children did not belong and where pedestrians were condemned as ""jaywalkers."" In Fighting Traffic, Peter Norton argues that to accommodate automobiles, the American city required not only a physical change but also a social one: before the city could be reconstructed for the sake of motorists, its streets had to be socially reconstructed as places where motorists belonged. It was not an evolution, he writes, but a bloody and sometimes violent revolution. Norton describes how street users struggled to define and redefine what streets were for. He examines developments in the crucial transitional years from the 1910s to the 1930s, uncovering a broad anti-automobile campaign that reviled motorists as ""road hogs"" or ""speed demons"" and cars as ""juggernauts"" or ""death cars."" He considers the perspectives of all users--pedestrians, police (who had to become ""traffic cops""), street railways, downtown businesses, traffic engineers (who often saw cars as the problem, not the solution), and automobile promoters. He finds that pedestrians and parents campaigned in moral terms, fighting for ""justice."" Cities and downtown businesses tried to regulate traffic in the name of ""efficiency."" Automotive interest groups, meanwhile, legitimized their claim to the streets by invoking ""freedom"" -- a rhetorical stance of particular power in the United States. Fighting Traffic offers a new look at both the origins of the automotive city in America and how social groups shape technological change.",Peter Norton,,2008

Eight underlying factors are reported: feeling unsafe (e.g., 'Drunk people put me off travelling by bus at night'); preference for walking or cycling (e.g., 'I prefer to walk'); problems with service provision (e.g., 'No direct route'); unwanted arousal (e.g., 'The buses are too crowded'); preference for car use (e.g., 'I feel more in control when I drive'); cost (e.g., 'The fares are too expensive'); disability and discomfort (e.g., 'There are not enough hand rails inside the bus'); and self-image (e.g., 'Travelling by bus does not create the right impression'). The influence of age, gender, household income, car availability and frequency of bus use on factor scores is reported. Analysis of write-in responses extended interpretation to include travelling by bus as a social behaviour in an exchange space and a formulation of the ideal, 'hassle-free', urban bus journey as pleasant/deactivated.","Stephen G.

We examined which motivational dimensions are underlying the (un)attractiveness of car use, in order to distinguish a limited set of main motive categories. Three methods were developed, which differed in the extent to which the purpose of the task was apparent. The tasks were: (1) a similarity sorting of car-use episodes, (2) a Q-sorting following attractiveness of car-use episodes, and (3) a semantic-differential method for evaluating (un)attractive aspects of car use. The symbolic-affective motives for car use were better expressed when the aim of the research task was not too apparent. If the aim of the task was evident, respondents tended to evaluate car use in terms of instrumental-reasoned motives. Overall, the results indicate that both instrumental-reasoned and symbolic-affective functions of the motor car are significant dimensions underlying the attractiveness of car use.","Linda Steg,Charles Vlek,C.A.J.

Two statistical methods (factor analysis and ordered logit modeling) have been used to assess the quality implications of the variability of the users' perceived satisfaction across operators. A market segmentation analysis (between male and female respondents) provides further insight into the differences among groups of the population. Five transit systems in the two major conurbations in Greece, Athens and Thessaloniki, have been examined. The analysis demonstrated that a well-coordinated transportation environment should be the primary aim of the policy makers in Athens, followed by other quality attributes such as service frequency and accessibility. In Thessaloniki, the sole transit operator should include in its policy plans immediate corrective measures addressing the service frequency, waiting time and vehicle cleanliness attributes.","Yannis Tyrinopoulos,Constantinos Antoniou",Transport Policy,2008
10.3141/2139-17,,,Individual Carbon Dioxide Emissions and Potential for Reduction in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom,"Using National Travel survey data from the Netherlands and the United Kingdom (UK), this paper examines how passenger transport emissions are divided across society and how similar this distribution is across these two countries. By looking across a series of data over time, the paper examines the extent to which the socio-economic characteristics of the main contributors of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are similar in these two countries. Based on the profiles of the main CO2 contributor, relevant policy measures are examined. The general effectiveness and acceptability of these measures are then discussed by drawing on pan-European (Eurobarometer) survey results. Analyses reveal that around 10% of the Dutch population is responsible for almost half of all travelrelated CO2 emissions in the Netherlands. Similarly, in the UK, around 20% of the population is responsible of the 60% of passenger transport-related CO2 emissions. Analysis of pan-European opinion surveys shows that there is a clear awareness among majority of the population that the type of car and the way it is used has an important impact on the environment. Despite this awareness, only a minority seem prepared to take action to reduce the environmnental consequences of their travel behaviour. The study supports the argument that the willingness to change behaviour is a complex mixture of individual and social interests. A major challenge is how to encourage changes in behaviour to reduce transport emissions with the right policies at the right time in the right place.","Yusak O.

Results of large-scale household travel surveys conducted in the Osaka metropolitan area of Japan in 1980, 1990 and 2000 are used with matching demographic, land use, and network data. Statistical examinations of the model systems indicate that the structural relationships underlying travel behavior have not been stable over the 20 years. Overall, expanding tendencies in out-of-home activity engagement and travel are exhibited by both auto and transit commuters, but in different ways. The study results challenge the conventional wisdom that auto travelers tend to chain trips; transit commuters make more stops and chain trips more often than do auto commuters in the Osaka area, suggesting that travel patterns are heavily influenced by transportation networks and land use developments.","Yusak O.

It finds that the modes are talked about in different ways: bus travel being referred to as a series of episodes mostly focussing on worst-case scenarios while car travel is represented as a more consistent commodity. Both modes exhibit different characteristics depending on whether the speaker is talking as a user or an observer. Buses are seen as benign from outside, beneficial to the area and potential congestion-busters but as vulnerable spaces for users. Nothing good was said about cars from outside, but they provided protective spaces supplying flexible travel and allowing social commitments to be met by users. This paper discusses how the insights gained could help improve the perception of bus travel and contribute to more sustainable travel choices.","J.W.

10.1016/j.tranpol.2010.08.005,,,The quality of service desired by public transport users,"This article describes the methodology used to study the quality of service desired by users of a public transport system. The desired quality is different from the perceived quality because it does not represent the daily experiences of the users, but rather what they desire, hope for or expect from their public transport system. This is why it is important to study the desired quality, knowledge of which gives local authorities the background information for personalised marketing policies based on the user's requirements rather than their daily perceptions. The methodology goes through several stages, such as the use of focus groups to choose the most important variables for the users, the design and use of unlabelled stated preferences surveys and the calibration of discrete choice models. All of these help determine the weight of the most relevant variables. The analysis is carried out with different categories of users and potential users (those people not currently using public transport). Waiting time, cleanliness and comfort are shown to be the public transport variables that users most valued, but the degree to which they are valued varies according to the category of user. Variables such as driver kindness, bus occupancy and journey time are generally given less weight. The first two vary little by user category, but some variability appears for journey time. For potential users the more important variables when defining expected quality from public transport are waiting time, journey time and above all, level of occupancy. They consider the other variables to be of little importance when defining an efficient public transport service. In order to improve service quality and attract more passengers to public transport in general, the application of this methodology provides the authorities and operating companies with useful information to plan personalised marketing policies specifically directed at different categories of users and potential users of public transport.","Luigi dell’Olio,Angel Ibeas,Patricia Cecín",Transport Policy,2011

In the public transport setting, such contributions have, with rare exception, not been considered. In this paper, we discuss and empirically illustrate the merits of advanced modelling developments aimed at improving our understanding of public transport choice, namely the inclusion of reliability in extended expected utility theoretic forms, to recognize risk attitude and perceptual conditioning, the consideration of passenger crowding and its inclusion in linear additive models, and the role of multiple heuristics in representing attribute processing as a way of conditioning modal choice. We illustrate the mechanics of introducing these behaviourally appealing extensions using a modal choice data set collected in Sydney.","David A. Hensher,John M.

10.3141/1985-22,,,Does a Grande Latte Really Stir Up Gridlock?: Stops in Commute Journeys and Incremental Travel,"Does a stop that a commuter makes on the way to or from work adversely affect peak period traffic? This question is addressed by examining the effects of stops made as part of commute journeys on daily, as well as peak period, travel time and distance, in a 6-week travel diary data set from Germany. Increments in travel time and distance due to stops made in commute journeys are evaluated, and a panel regression analysis is performed to determine contributions of stops of different types to travel time and distance. It was found that the travel time and distance of a commute journey increase with the number of stops and that incorporating stops as part of commute journeys tends to make daily travel more efficient, with more distances traversed in relatively less time than when the same number of stops are all made outside the commute journey. Nonetheless, stops in commute journeys do add to peak period travel time and distance. Stops made before work do not produce much incremental travel in the morning peak period. Stops made after work, however, substantially add to peak period travel time and distance as well as daily travel time and distance. In particular, a home-based journey made after returning home contributes to afternoon peak traffic more than does a stop in a work-to-home commute journey.","Ryuichi Kitamura,Yusak O.
